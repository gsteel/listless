## Introduction & Motivation

The purpose of this library is to provide a simple and stable api with which to get email addresses on and off of third party mailing list platforms for your app so that you, and I can spend less time writing abstractions to iron out the disparities between the myriad mailing list operators out there.

I'm also using this collection of projects as a learning exercise to increase my knowledge and comfort with [psalm](https://psalm.dev) and [infection](https://infection.github.io).

## Installation

As currently unstable wip, you'll need to

```shell
composer install list-interop/listless dev-main
```

These contracts aren't going to get you far, so you'll want an implementation. There's only 1 in the works right now:
[Email Octopus](https://github.com/list-interop/listless-octopus) â€¦ but, the plan is to at least get MailChimp running and possibly something home-grown.

If you're interested, dive in with the pull requests.
